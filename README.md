## 🧠 Intelligent Features

OpenQode Gen 5 introduces a powerful suite of intelligent automation features designed for maximum productivity:

![Features Panel](assets/features-smartx.png)

### 🔀 Multi-Agent Mode (`/agents`)
Enables dynamic multi-agent orchestration. The AI intelligently selects and coordinates specialized agents based on your project's requirements—from code generation to debugging, testing, and documentation—all working in concert.

### 🧩 Smart Context (`/context`)
Persistent context sharing across agents and sessions. Your conversation history, project state, and decisions are preserved—even after restarting the TUI. Multiple agents can seamlessly share context for coherent, continuous collaboration.

### 💭 Exposed Thinking (`/thinking`)
Transparency mode that reveals the AI's reasoning process in real-time. Watch as the agent analyzes problems, considers alternatives, and formulates solutions—giving you insight into every decision.

### 🚀 SmartX Engine (`/smartx`)
Autonomous error-recovery mode. When enabled, the AI will **automatically retry and heal** from errors rather than stopping to ask for input. Failed commands, broken builds, and runtime errors are diagnosed and fixed in a continuous loop until resolved.

### ⚡ AutoRun (`/auto`)
System-level autonomous execution. An extension of SmartX that grants the AI permission to perform file operations, run shell commands, and manage server tasks **without requiring manual approval**. Perfect for hands-free automation workflows.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Combine **SmartX + AutoRun** for fully autonomous coding sessions. Press `ESC` at any time to abort!

## 🔧 Smart Repair Agent v2.0

When your TUI crashes or encounters errors, **Smart Repair** is an AI-powered self-healing system that diagnoses and fixes issues automatically.

![Smart Repair Agent](assets/smart-repair.png)

### What It Does:
- **Analyze Errors** - Paste any crash/error message
- **AI Diagnosis** - Identifies root cause using Qwen AI models
- **Auto-Fix** - Runs repair commands (`npm install`, `git pull`, etc.)
- **Verify** - Checks if the fix was successful

### How to Access:

| Platform | Menu Option |
|----------|-------------|
| **Windows** | `OpenQode.bat` → Option **9** |
| **Linux/Mac** | `./OpenQode.sh` → Option **7** |
| **Direct** | `node bin/smart-repair.mjs` |

### Commands Inside Smart Repair:
- **Paste error** → AI analyzes and suggests fix
- **`model`** → Switch AI model (Coder Plus, Plus, Turbo)
- **`auth`** → Trigger Qwen authentication
- **`quit`** → Exit

---

## ⚡ Feature: Zero-Config Authentication
OpenQode attempts to use your existing Qwen CLI authentication. 
- Using standard **Option 5**, simply follow the prompts.
- If it's your first time, you may need to authenticate via browser.
- The assistant is designed to be "Hassle Free"!

### 🔑 Advanced Configuration
If you have your own API keys or specialized setup:
1. Copy `config.example.cjs` to `config.cjs`.
2. Edit `config.cjs` to add your keys.
